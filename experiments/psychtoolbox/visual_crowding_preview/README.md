Description of the experiment:

This experiment examines the crowding and preview effects in the Arabic language, utilizing three distinct crowding values: 0, -75, and -125. Within the experiment, these values are represented as follows: 1 for -125, 2 for -75, and 3 for 0. The study employs magnetoencephalography (MEG) and eye-tracking techniques to record brain activity.

In this paradigm, participants are instructed to focus on a fixation point on the screen. Words will be presented either to the left or right of the fixation point, and participants will be required to look at the presented word when cued by the fixation point turning green.
