Description of the experiment:

This experiment examines the crowding and preview effects in the Arabic language, utilizing three distinct crowding values: 0, -75, and -125. Within the experiment, these values are represented as follows: 1 for -125, 2 for -75, and 3 for 0. The study employs magnetoencephalography (MEG) and eye-tracking techniques to record brain activity.

In this paradigm, participants are instructed to focus on a fixation point on the screen. Words will be presented either to the left or right of the fixation point, and participants will be required to look at the presented word when cued by the fixation point turning green. After that, the participant has to decide weather or not the word displayed is the same your they saw during the trial by answering the question 'Is this the last word you saw?'.

The trigger channels in MEG are as follows: 

trigger channel 224: beginn of the overall experiment.
trigger channel 225: each display of the fixation point.
trigger channel 226: display of the preview image.
trigger channel 227: display of the cue (fixation point turns green).
trigger channel 228: saccade detection.
trigger channel 229: display of the target image.
trigger channel 230: display of the question image. 

Triggers 227, 228, 229 should appear almost at the same time.
