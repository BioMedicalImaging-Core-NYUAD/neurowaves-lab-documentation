ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) systems in the MEG laboratory and EEG setup
within Brain Imaging Core Technology Platform. MEG lab is situated in A2, 008, Ground floor, New York University Abu Dhabi.

It offers a *simple* and *intuitive* overview on how MEG machines work, the specification of the system, what kind of data are generated and how to process them using *ready-to-use* pipelines. This documentation additionally provides a guide to build your own MEG-system experiment and what is required to successfully execute the experiment.
