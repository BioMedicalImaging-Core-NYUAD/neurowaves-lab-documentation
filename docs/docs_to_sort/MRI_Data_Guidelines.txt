MRI Data Storage: Suggested Protocols
June 21 2018

			** MAC ONLY **

		****** BEFORE YOU START *******

*Add the participant to the "MRI_Participant_INFO" document.
*Add the MRI number and sharing info to the NYUAD NeLLab Participants Sheet.
*You will need a Matlab version beyond 2016a.

*Make sure that you have the following 2 Drives mounted on your computer 
	smb://10.230.16.16/MEG2
	smb://10.230.16.16/nifti_converted
	
If you do not have access to these drives, you will need to contact:
Julien - for MEG2 (NeLLab members only)
Osama - for nifti_converted	

* For the Freesurfer processing, you will need access to Dalma from the 
high performance computing cluster team. See here:
https://wikis.nyu.edu/display/ADRC/HPC
-You'll need to be somewhat familiar with basic linux commands to run this.
There are tutorials and other info on the HPC wiki.


		*******************************
		 	Data Formatting		
		*******************************
		
1) After acquisition, Haidee will transfer the data to /Volumes/nifti_converted (this may change)

2) Copy this folder to our server MEG2/MRI_Data/data/nifti_converted so that we have a copy.

3) Run the HCP Preprocessing MATLAB script (USER INPUT REQUIRED) to convert this to HCP-format.

A template copy of this is available in MEG2/MRI_Data/User_Scripts/Template_Scripts.
Your own version of this can be kept in MEG2/User_Scripts.

* Set the subjectId to the MEG subject number (e.g. ‘A0167’) so that it can be used w. MEG.
* Set the sourcefolder to /Volumes/MEG2/MRI_Data/data/nifti_converted
* Set the targetfolder to /Volumes/MEG2/MRI_Data/data/HCP
* Change fieldMap file names to those in the source folder.
* leave the GRE file fields empty, it will find them.

4) After running, confirm that the data have been saved to MRI_Data/data/HCP
* The MATLAB Script should output a Figure of 2 magnitude maps, and the phase difference.

			Preprocessing
		*******************************

5) Copy the HCP format data to /scratch on Dalma. Here's an example of how to do that from Terminal:
scp -r A0167 netid@dalma.abudhabi.nyu.edu:/scratch/netid

6) SSH onto Dalma:
ssh netid@dalma.abudhabi.nyu.edu

7) Change your directory to /scratch , which is where we'll run things.
cd $SCRATCH

7) Load the braincore module:
module load braincore/1.0

8) Run the pipeline script (~12 hours to complete)
run-pipeline.sh -d /scratch/netid -s A0167 -b prefs - e postfs

*To check on the status of the job(s) type:
squeue -u netid

*Under "ST" it will have "R" for running, "PD" for pending, and "CD" for completed.
*It will also tell you which jobs are dependent upon others.

*Errors are logged in /subjectID/logs

*The freesurfer output will be in subjectID/T1w/subjectID

9) Copy the data back to MEG2: Run this on your local computer:
scp netid@dalma.abudhabi.nyu.edu/scratch/netid/subjectID /Volumes/MEG2/MRI_Data/data/Post_FS/

*** The folder that you will want to copy to the MRI folder for your experiment is located
*** at Post_FS/SubjectID/T1w/SubjectID.

			Prep for MEG Source Reconstruction
		**************************************************
(Only when native MRI)
10) Open up Terminal on your computer, and start a unix shell session by typing:
tcsh

11) Set up some environment variables that we need. Customize this to your computer:

setenv SUBJECTS_DIR /Users/megstaff/ExperimentName/mri # Where MRI folders are being kept

setenv FREESURFER_HOME /Applications/freesurfer # Where freesurfer is (should be the same)
source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.csh

cd $SUBJECTS_DIR

setenv SUBJECT subjectID # The subject id you’re currently working on.

12) Create the .seghead files for bem generation by typing:
mkheadsurf -subjid $SUBJECT (Only when native MRI)

13) Now generate the bem (this takes a little while):
mne watershed_bem --subject $SUBJECT

*** You are now ready to start mne-python preprocessing with this subject’s MRI.

*** To confirm that everything is in order, start a coregistration GUI, and check that the 
*** ptp’s MRI and head model load when you select them from the drop-down menu (top-left).
*** You will need to manually enter the location of the fiducial landmarks using the mouse.

*** For further sanity checks, see MRI_Data_SanityChecks.py
