Data Quality Dashboards
#######################

An MEG signal is a tiny magnetic fields, in the order of 100 fT, where
femtotesla  :math:`1fT = 10^{-15} T` and picotesla :math:`1pT = 10^{-12} T`.

EEG scalp signals are about 50 to 100 :math:`\mu\text{V}`


Several metrics are defined in the below table and will serve as basis to asess the quality of data.
