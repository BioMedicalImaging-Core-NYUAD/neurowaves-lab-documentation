KIT Data Quality Dashboard
==========================

This dashboard monitors the quality of the data generated from the KIT-MEG system.
Several metrics can be measured using empty-room data to ensure high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).

- Some parLook in the lab manual to see the data quality
- Whitening the data ïƒ¨ compute a noise vector
- Poor SNR, can lead to experiments needing more number of trials
- In language studies, much more trials are needed because the activation of the brain regions are more subtle
