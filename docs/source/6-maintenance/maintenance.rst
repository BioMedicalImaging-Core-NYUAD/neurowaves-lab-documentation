Maintenance of MEG system
*************************

Checks to be made
-----------------

Helium level

* Every two days check Helium Level it should be higher than 50%
* Check the ATP and ATL gas flow and pressure
    * If low Helium pressure (Low G FLOW on the ATL) then
        * Remove the hose between ATP and ATL
        * Check if helium is passing through the hose
        * Plug the hose again, see if G Flow increases
        * Restart the ATL from the green button on the rear panel


Data retrieval from ATP and ATL for diagnostic
----------------------------------------------
When the ATP and ATL helium recovery system exhibits low gas flow or unusual temperature/pressure,
contact the references below and provide them the following data

#. Retrieve data from ATP and ATL by opening an FTP connection to 10.224.44.200 and 10.224.44.201
#. Connect to the NYU Abu Dhabi VPN
#. Use the following information username: qd, password: 79653
#. Navigate to the */StorageCard/DAT_Files/* directory for each of the previous IP addresses, send the latest *.dat* files

Check air pressure every month

-	The air pressure inside the meg can be not so good, it must be 0.7, 0.8 this could be a compressor problem
-	When the air pressure is low, the door could be stuck

MSR Door:

- Test the emergency button every week
- Test if the pressure release when using the emergency button is getting heavier or not releasing pressure as it is supposed to be
- If using the manual handle, make sure that to reset the door, you need to put the handle in the original position or else the door wonâ€™t reset



Helium refill process
---------------------

- Bijoy (bs4233@nyu.edu) will indicate that Helium tanks are needed, he will communicate to Neelima Dinil (nd1508@nyu.edu) this need
- Hadi will receive an email to approve the Helium tanks needs
- Hadi will confirm the needs by replying and putting Osama, Bijoy, Neelima and Nyavili Miyanda (vili.mulemba@nyu.edu) in copy
- Nileema will schedule with Bijoy the delivery of the tanks
- Bijoy will schedule the Helium refilling as necessary
- When a new PO is needed to cover for the dewar costs, issue one using the CTP Requisition form then inform Jinna


The ATL tank (QD recovery system) will be used to refill the dewar. However, when the tanks inside ATL room are full, we need to evacuate some Helium into the lab
so that the ATL tank starts to fill again when placed into the recovery system.

Request for new equipment/IT or Helium Dewar
--------------------------------------------

CTP members can raise requests to purchase new needed equipment, lab supplies and so on.
