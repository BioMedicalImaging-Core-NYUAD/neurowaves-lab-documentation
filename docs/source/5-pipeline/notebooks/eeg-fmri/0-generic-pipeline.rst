Pre-processing of the EEG data
------------------------------




ECG Removal
~~~~~~~~~~~
- The subtraction method can work better than ICA, use the substraction method to remove ECG signals

Steps for noise removal and pre-processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Gradient artifact correction:
  - Always remove the gradient artifacts first.
  - ECG with gradient artifacts can be saturated sometimes, which means that the ECG sensor should be moved around.
  - MRI artifact correction: then pick use markers, then R128, making sure the correction is only during these triggers and not for the rest.
  - Then Next.
  - Artifact Type is always **Continuous** (interleaved was an old thing when MRI was collected for a period of time and then EEG for another period of time).
  - Enable **Baseline correction for average** (compute baseline over the whole artifact).
  - Use **sliding average calculation** to account for changes in gradient artifacts over time.
  - Do not select **Common use of all channels** for bad intervals and correlation.
  - Then next: select all EEG channels (only time we donâ€™t use all channels is if we are measuring a specific thing).
  - Then next: deselect downsampling (we can do this later).
  - How to store data Select **store corrected data** in a cached file.

- ECG signals correction after gradient artifact cleaning:
  - Also use a **sliding average subtraction** approach (Not ICA), use ICA if there is a residual.
  - We do not have markers on the peaks (this is needed for the subtraction method).
  - We need to add **R peaks** (peaks on the ECG signals).
  - After the gradient artifact correction, some high-frequency noise stays in the ECG channel during MRI acquisition.
  - Apply **High Cutoff Frequency**: go to **Transformations**, then **IIR filter**, disable the Low cutoff and High cutoff of all channels, then select only the ECG channel and apply a high cutoff (15 Hz), then apply filter.
  - Then **Transformations**, **Special Signal Processing**, then **CB correction**.
  - Choose the **ECG channel** (if it's a clear heartbeat, if not use another EEG channel that shows a clearer one than ECG).
  - Go through the manual check if the automatic analyzer skipped some R peaks.
  - After selecting all the R peaks (which should be marked in Green), click **Finish**.
  - Then the R peaks should appear on the peaks as R.
  - Go to **Special Signal Processing**, select **CB**, then select **Use Markers**, then select **R markers**.
  - Then next, and use the whole data to compute the time delay. The total number of pulses is the sliding signal window. Empirically, we use 21 as the parameters.
  - Select all EEG channels except for CWL and the ECG channel.

- Carbon Wired Loops (CWL), accounts for movement correction:
  - Change sampling rate: we need to downsample and then apply the **CWL regression**.

We can automate the process by saving all the analysis steps.


Helium Pump Noise:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Components around the 50Hz frequency should appear in all channels.
- The helium pumps cannot be turned off during an experiment.

Pre-processing steps should involve:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Inspecting the static field data.
2. Gradient-artifact correction.
3. ECG correction or CWL regression (Cardioballistic artifacts).
4. Classic EEG analysis.
