Maintenance of MEG system
=========================


-	The air pressure inside the meg can be not so good, it must be 0.7, 0.8 this could be a compressor problem
-	When the air pressure is low, the door could be stuck

Test the emergency button every week
Test if the pressure release when using the emergency button is getting heavier or not releasing pressure as it is supposed to be

If using the manual handle, make sure that to reset the door, you need to put the handle in the original position or else the door wonâ€™t reset
