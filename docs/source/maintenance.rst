Maintenance of MEG system
=========================


Checks to be made
-----------------

Helium level

* Every two days check Helium Level it should be higher than 50%
* Check the ATP and ATL gas flow and pressure
    * If low Helium pressure (Low G FLOW on the ATL) then
        * Remove the hose between ATP and ATL
        * Check if helium is passing through the hose
        * Plug the hose again, see if G Flow increases
        * Restart the ATL from the green button on the rear panel

* Retrieve data from ATP and ATL by opening an FTP connection to 10.224.44.200, username: qd, password: 79653 (VPN to NYU must be enabled)

Check air pressure every month

-	The air pressure inside the meg can be not so good, it must be 0.7, 0.8 this could be a compressor problem
-	When the air pressure is low, the door could be stuck

MSR Door:

- Test the emergency button every week
- Test if the pressure release when using the emergency button is getting heavier or not releasing pressure as it is supposed to be
- If using the manual handle, make sure that to reset the door, you need to put the handle in the original position or else the door wonâ€™t reset
