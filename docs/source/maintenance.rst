Maintenance of MEG system
=========================


Checks to be made
-----------------

Helium level

- Every two days check Helium Level it should be higher than 50%
- Check the ATP and ATL gas flow and pressure


Check air pressure every month

-	The air pressure inside the meg can be not so good, it must be 0.7, 0.8 this could be a compressor problem
-	When the air pressure is low, the door could be stuck

MSR Door:

- Test the emergency button every week
- Test if the pressure release when using the emergency button is getting heavier or not releasing pressure as it is supposed to be
- If using the manual handle, make sure that to reset the door, you need to put the handle in the original position or else the door wonâ€™t reset
