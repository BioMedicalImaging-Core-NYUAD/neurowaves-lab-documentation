Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Crash Course
=========================================


What is MEG?
============

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive imaging technique used to measure the magnetic fields produced by neuronal activity in the brain. This method provides high temporal resolution, making it valuable for understanding the dynamics of neural processes.

Key Principles of MEG
=====================

1. **Neuronal Activity**: Neurons in the brain communicate via electrical impulses. When groups of neurons fire synchronously, they produce magnetic fields.
2. **Magnetic Field Detection**: MEG sensors detect these magnetic fields, allowing researchers to infer neural activity.
3. **Non-invasive**: Unlike invasive techniques, MEG does not require any surgical procedures, making it safe and suitable for repeated use.

MEG System Components
======================

1. **Magnetometers and Gradiometers**: Sensors that detect magnetic fields. Gradiometers are used to measure the gradient of the magnetic field, which helps in distinguishing the brain's magnetic signals from environmental noise.
2. **Dewar**: A container filled with liquid helium that keeps the sensors at superconducting temperatures.
3. **Shielded Room**: MEG measurements are often conducted in rooms shielded from external magnetic noise.

MEG Data Acquisition
=====================

1. **Preparation**: Subjects wear a helmet with embedded sensors. Electrodes may also be attached to the scalp for additional reference.
2. **Recording**: The subject performs tasks or is exposed to stimuli while the MEG system records the magnetic fields.
3. **Data Processing**: Raw MEG data undergoes preprocessing to remove noise and artifacts.

MEG Analysis Techniques
=======================

1. **Source Localization**: Identifying the specific brain regions generating the observed magnetic fields. Common methods include:
   - **Minimum Norm Estimates (MNE)**
   - **Beamforming**
   - **Dipole Fitting**
2. **Time-Frequency Analysis**: Examining how the spectral content of the MEG signal changes over time.
3. **Connectivity Analysis**: Assessing functional and effective connectivity between different brain regions.

Applications of MEG
===================

1. **Cognitive Neuroscience**: Studying brain functions such as perception, memory, and language.
2. **Clinical Applications**: Diagnosing and monitoring conditions like epilepsy, brain tumors, and psychiatric disorders.
3. **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)**: Developing systems that allow direct communication between the brain and external devices.

Advantages and Limitations
===========================

Advantages
----------

- **High Temporal Resolution**: MEG can capture rapid changes in brain activity.
- **Non-invasive**: Safe for repeated use across various populations.
- **Direct Measurement**: Unlike fMRI, MEG measures neural activity directly.




Limitations
-----------

- **Cost**: MEG systems are expensive to purchase and maintain.
- **Sensitivity to Noise**: MEG measurements can be affected by environmental magnetic noise.
- **Spatial Resolution**: Although better than EEG, MEG's spatial resolution is still inferior to fMRI.

Getting Started with MEG Research
=================================

1. **Training**: Gain a strong foundation in neuroscience and signal processing.
2. **Tools and Software**: Familiarize yourself with MEG analysis software such as MNE-Python, FieldTrip, and Brainstorm.
3. **Collaborations**: Work with experts in MEG and related fields to design and interpret experiments.

Conclusion
==========

MEG is a powerful tool for investigating the dynamics of brain activity. Its high temporal resolution and non-invasive nature make it ideal for a wide range of applications in both research and clinical settings. With proper training and resources, researchers can leverage MEG to gain deeper insights into neural processes.




Neuroscience background
=======================

A neuron is composed of a soma (cell body), axiom (covered in myelin sheath), dendrites.

Dednrites function is to receive information from other neurons, called pre-synaptic neurons or from the environment.
Apical Dendrite emerges from the apex of a pyramidal cell.



AP (Action Potential), an Action Potential can be triggered in a neuron by pre-synaptic potentials, when the total amount of excitation is above a certain threshold.


A synapse is a junction between two neurons (nerve cells) or between a neuron and another type of cells, that allows the transmission of signals between the cells.
