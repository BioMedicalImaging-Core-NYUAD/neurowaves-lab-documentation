Setting up your environment for processing
------------------------------------------



We recommend to install MNE as a standalone installer.

The data of the MNE environment will be under ``C:\ProgramData\mne-python\1.6.1_0``

You can setup Pycharm to use this environment as a Python environment for your pipeline project.

The configuration file for setting ``SUBJECTS_DIR``, the directory to the data of your subject, can be set in:
``C:\Users\user_name\.mne\mne-python.json``
