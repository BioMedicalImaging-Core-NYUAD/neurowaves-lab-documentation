Designing your EEG-fMRI experiment
==================================

Multiple things have to be taken into account while designing your EEG-fMRI experiment.

Before that, identify your research question and why it is relevant to use EEG-fMRI
for the research question.

Ensure:

- that you will be using the MRI sequences specific for the EEG-fMRI
- that you know your Time Response (in ms) time as you will need this value in the analysis pipeline
- Every EEG-fMRI experiment show
    - that you have a jitter (random time) before showing stimulus at the beginning of every TR, if this is not the case, one of the gradient artifact filters might delete important ERP's from your EEG data
