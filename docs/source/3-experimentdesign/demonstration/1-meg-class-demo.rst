Cognitive Neuroscience class MEG demonstration
==============================================

Date and place: MEG lab in A2-008 at the 9th of October 2024
12:15 to 2pm

Agenda
------


.. dropdown:: Lab tour and general equipment presentation `10min`

    - Explain the dewar, SQUIDs sensors, liquid Helium system
    - Explain the MSR (Magnetically Shielded Room)
    - Show the computers layout and the different capabilities of the lab (eyetracker, vpixx triggers, response box, audio stimulus)
    - Present what experiments we will run on this day and the outline of the demonstration

.. dropdown:: Prepare the participant for an MEG experiment `20min`

    - Perform laser scan of headhape on the participant
    - Place participant in MSR, explain the headcoils placed on participant head
    - Perform auditory check for safety

.. dropdown:: SQUID sensors demonstration `5min`

    - Show sensitivity to noise, rapid eyeblinks, teeth pressure, phone in airplane mode on and off
    - Show marker measurement and explain their importance for source localization
    - Show reference magnetometers and explain denoising for external noise

.. dropdown:: Two demonstrations: Resting state :ref:`resting_state_exp` and attention (contra-lateral) :ref:`attention_exp` `50min`

    - Experiment 1: Resting state: `25min` :ref:`resting_state_exp`
        - Two blocks: a block of 10min eyes open and 10min eyes closed
    - Experiment 2: Attention with different field of view points `25min`
        - the participant is asked to focus on a centered point for some duration of time
        - at some instant, a flash to a point in the far left of the visual field will appear
        - the participant must press a button when they see the flash
        - the experiment repeats itself for the right side.


.. dropdown:: Show analysis results `15min`

    - Experiment 1: Resting state
        - Show higher alpha power in eyes closed than in eyes open in the alpha band (8-12Hz)
        - Show that this difference is better seen in the occipital region
    - Experiment 2: Attention
        - NA
        - NA
