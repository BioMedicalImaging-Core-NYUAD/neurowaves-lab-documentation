Cognitive Neuroscience class MEG demonstration
==============================================

Date and place: MEG lab in A2-008 at the 9th of October 2024
12:15 to 2pm

Agenda:

- Lab tour and general equipment information `10min`
    - Explain the MSR (Magnetically Shielded Room)
    - Explain the dewar, SQUIDs sensors, liquid Helium system
    - Show the computers layout and the different capabilities of the lab (eyetracker, vpixx triggers, response box, audio stimulus)
- Prepare the participant for an MEG experiment `20min`
    - Perform laser scan of headhape on the participant
    - Place participant in MSR, explain the headcoils placed on participant head
    - Perform auditory check for safety
- SQUID sensors demonstration `5min`
    - Show sensitivity to noise, rapid eyeblinks, teeth pressure, phone in airplane mode on and off
    - Show reference magnetometers and explain denoising for external noise
- Two demonstrations: Resting state and attention (contra-lateral)
    - Experiment 1: Resting state: `25min`
        - Two blocks: a block of 10min eyes open and 10min eyes closed
    - Experiment 2: Attention with different field of view points `25min`
        - participant looking to a point in the far left of the visual field for 10 minutes
        - when the duration is over, a stimulus will flash, the participant must press a button when they see the flash
        - the experiment repeats itself for the right side

- Show analysis results:
    - Experiment 1: Resting state
        - Show higher alpha power in eyes closed than in eyes open in the alpha band (8-12Hz)
        - Show that this difference is better seen in the occipital region
    - Experiment 2: Attention
        - NA
        - NA
