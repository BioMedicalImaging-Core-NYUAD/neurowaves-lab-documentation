Cognitive Neuroscience class MEG demonstration
==============================================

Date and place: MEG lab in A2-008 at the 9th of October 2024
12:15 to 2pm

Agenda:

- Lab tour and general equipment information
- Show preparation of a participant
- Perform laser scan of headhape on the participant
- Place participant in MSR, explain the headcoils placed on participant's head
- Perform auditory check for safety
- SQUID sensor demonstration: show sensitivity to noise, rapid eyeblinks, teeth pressure, phone in airplane mode on and off
- Two demonstrations: Resting state and attention (contra-lateral)
    - Experiment 1: Resting state:
        - Two blocks: a block of 10min eyes open and 10min eyes closed
    - Experiment 2: Attention with different field of view points
        - participant looking to far left point for some time
        - participant looking to far right point for some time

- Show analysis results:
    - Experiment 1: Resting state
        - Show higher alpha power in eyes closed than in eyes open in the alpha band (8-12Hz)
        - Show that this difference is better seen in the occipital region
    - Experiment 2: Attention
        - NA
        - NA
