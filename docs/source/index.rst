**MEG/EEG-pipeline** provides documentation for the Magnetoencephalography (MEG) system in the MEG laboratory and EEG setup within Brain Imaging Core Technology Platform.
It offers a *simple* and *intuitive* overview on how MEG machines work, the specification of the system, what kind of data are generated and how to process them using *ready-to-use* pipelines. This documentation additionally provides a guide to build your own MEG-system experiment and what is required to successfully execute the experiment.
